			<p>Take a look at Gokus simple profile CV below</p>
			<p>Goku's a great fighter but he's not much of a CV writer!</p>
			<p>Your challenge is to download his CV. Customise it to be a profile about you and then improve how it looks!</p>
			<p>If you need tips on writing HTML, CSS, Javascript then click here <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>

			<p style="font-weight:bold;">So you will</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and Create a github account</li>
				<li>Fork our repository from <a href="https://github.com/code-untapped/code-untapped.github.io">Code Untapped Github</a></li>
				<li>Copy and improve Gokus "bad" cv template using the cv skills you have learnt in previous workshops. Beginners you might just change the name, whilst the advanced can go to town and make as many improvements as you wish! If you can find the CSS style sheet play with that! Check out Ez Simple CV for an example </li>
